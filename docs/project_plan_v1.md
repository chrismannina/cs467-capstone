**Introduction**

In this project, we aim to develop a system that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-3.5/4 and the practical utility of vector stores to interpret complex medical guidelines. The goal is to provide a more user-friendly, accurate, and efficient interface for healthcare practitioners, thus simplifying their decision-making process in clinical scenarios.

---

**Background and Prior Approaches**

Medical guidelines are often intricate and extensive, making them challenging for healthcare practitioners to comprehend quickly. To resolve this issue, our approach entails combining LLMs with a vector store to create an interactive and responsive query system capable of comprehending and responding to complex clinical questions.

---

**Planned Experimental Approaches**

Our experiment will focus on developing an application that allows users to upload clinical guidelines into a vector database and use an enhanced ChatGPT model to interpret these guidelines and answer relevant clinical questions. We also plan to assess the trade-off between the number of documents stored in the vector database and the accuracy of ChatGPT's responses.

**Required Technologies**

The project will require the following technologies:

1. Language Model: ChatGPT-3.5/4
2. Embedding Model: TBD
3. Vector Database: Chroma or Pinecone
4. Database Interface: To interact with the vector database
5. Query Interface: To interact with the user
6. Language model API: OpenAI API

**Other**

In order to ensure the success of this project, we'll need the following resources:

1. Access to clinical guidelines for testing and experimentation.
2. Computing resources for training and deploying the LLM and vector store.
3. Domain expert consultation for accurate interpretation of clinical guidelines.

---

**Conclusion**

By creating a system that bridges the gap between the extensive knowledge embedded in clinical guidelines and the practical need for efficient, user-friendly interfaces for healthcare practitioners, we hope to improve decision-making in clinical scenarios. This project represents an exciting intersection of AI and healthcare and has potential implications for other domains where complex documents guide crucial decisions.
