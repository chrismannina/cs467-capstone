**Slide 1**: 
*"Hello! I'm Chris Mannina, and I'd like to introduce you to our project: Medical Document Querying Using Language Models and Vector Stores."*

**Slide 2**: 
*"Our project aims to revolutionize the way medical professionals interact with vast medical guidelines. With the use of advanced language models and vector stores, we provide a platform for rapid and concise querying."*

**Slide 3**: 
*"In an era where Large Language Models are transforming various sectors, healthcare stands as a domain ripe for disruption. Our project is compelling as it addresses the challenge of deciphering voluminous medical literature, making it accessible and actionable."*

**Slide 4**: 
*"Let's delve into some highlights. Our system allows users to upload medical documents, segment them, and pose direct questions. With the integration of vector stores and language models, users receive insightful answers, bridging the gap between complex literature and concise responses."*

**Slide 5**: 
*"The development journey was an amalgamation of innovation and adaptation. We employed Python, coupled with libraries such as Streamlit, FAISS, Chroma, and OpenAI. The project's architecture evolved to incorporate vector stores and modular prompts, enhancing its efficiency and accuracy."*

**Slide 6**: 
*"Development was not without its challenges. We grappled with the unstructured nature of PDF text extraction and the inherent limitations of language models. However, these challenges paved the way for learning and growth, pushing us to innovate and refine our approach."*

**Slide 7**: 
*"As for the future, we envision this system as a beacon for AI-driven medical literature interpretation. There's potential for commercial applications and further development, especially as we look to refine text extraction, optimize configurations, and explore broader use cases."*
