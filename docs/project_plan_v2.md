**Introduction**

The proposed capstone project is positioned at the convergence of cutting-edge artificial intelligence and healthcare, aiming to revolutionize the interpretation of clinical guidelines. The objective is to augment a Large Language Model (LLM) such as ChatGPT-3.5/4 with vector stores to construct a highly intuitive, reliable, and efficient clinical decision-making support system.

---

**Background and Prior Approaches**

In the realm of healthcare, clinical guidelines serve as an invaluable reservoir of medical knowledge, guiding healthcare professionals in making the best patient care decisions. However, the expansive and intricate nature of these guidelines often creates challenges for quick and easy interpretation. 

Previous solutions have attempted to solve this issue using natural language processing, but they fall short of providing a comprehensive, interactive, and efficient interpretation. In response to this gap, our project will leverage the combined power of LLMs and vector stores, intending to build an innovative and intuitive application that enhances the utility and accessibility of clinical guidelines.

---

**Planned Experimental Approaches**

Our approach consists of creating an application that allows users to perform two crucial tasks: 

1. Upload a clinical guideline into a vector database.
2. Query the enhanced LLM (connected to the vector database) with clinical-related questions and receive detailed responses.

Moreover, the application's functionality will be underpinned by an exploratory analysis of the trade-off between the number of documents/guidelines stored in the vector database and the accuracy of ChatGPT's responses. We will also delve into the investigation of effective embedding search strategies and their impact on performance.

**Required Technologies**

The following components will be harnessed to bring this innovative application to life:

1. Large Language Model: OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5/4
2. Embedding Model: The optimal choice will be determined as the project unfolds
3. Vector Database: Possible candidates include Chroma or Pinecone
4. Database Interface: Custom-built interface to interact with the vector database
5. Query Interface: An intelligent interface designed to engage users and facilitate queries
6. LangChain: A framework that connects LLMs to other data sources and allows LLM to interact with its environment
7. OpenAI API: An interface that communicates with the language model
