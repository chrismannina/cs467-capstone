Great, now with everything you know about the project we are going to create a final report. These are the specifications: 
- A 2-3 page Final Report
- A 1-page Installation document that describes where/how to install or access your project output. Websites should include site links, test credentials, etc.
- A 1-2 page Instructions document that lists what to do, step by step, to examine, and play with your project. You should include screenshots for UI examples.
- All documents:  Title page (Project name, Team Members, Course, Date), Single-spaced, IEEE style references, Images must have captions.

Write this report as if someone reading it has not yet used your software, or perhaps never will (i.e., this report is separate and distinct from your other project deliverables). It should contain: 
1. An introduction
2. A description of what your software does from the user's perspective.
3. A description of your development efforts compared and contrasted with the project plan. If there were major deviations, be sure to talk about why and what changed.
4. A listing of the major software libraries, languages, APIs, development tools, servers, and other systems you used to create the software or system setup, and deeper discussions of any of those you want to talk more about.
5. A listing of what each team member accomplished.
6. The conclusion should sum up the above and discuss future directions.

Since this is technically an industry project with a healthcare institution external to OSU, I should include a "Project Continuance" section where I mention:
- Current release problems/workarounds.
- Possible next phase priorities.
