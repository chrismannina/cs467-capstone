Certainly! Given the information you've shared and the title you've chosen, let's craft a poster layout:

**Title**: 
"Medical Document Querying Using Language Models and Vector Stores"

**Subheader**:
"Transforming Raw Medical Text into Actionable, Personalized Insights"

**Sections**:

1. **Introduction**:
   "Harness the power of advanced language models and vector stores to extract and answer questions from vast medical documents. This system breaks down documents, embeds them as vectors, and utilizes a language model to provide precise answers to user queries."

2. **How It Works**:
   - **Document Processing**: Documents are broken down into smaller, manageable text chunks.
   - **Vector Embedding**: Text chunks are converted into vectors using state-of-the-art models like BERT or GPT, capturing the essence of the text.
   - **Vector Storage**: These vectors are stored in a structured vector database, ensuring similar vectors are close to each other.
   - **Query Processing**: User questions are also converted into vectors, which are then matched against the vector database.
   - **Answer Generation**: Relevant text chunks are fed into the language model, which crafts a detailed response based on the content.

3. **Key Features**:
   - **Personalized Responses**: Tailored answers based on the specifics of your medical documents.
   - **Scalable**: Capable of handling vast amounts of data, from individual reports to extensive medical guidelines.
   - **Fast Querying**: Utilizing vector stores allows for rapid search and retrieval, even in vast datasets.
   - **Secure**: Ensures the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive medical data.

4. **Use Case Scenarios**:
   (Consider adding a few real-world scenarios where this system could be beneficial. E.g., "A medical researcher quickly finds guidelines related to a specific rare disease without sifting through hundreds of pages.")

5. **Technical Highlights**:
   A section showcasing a few code snippets or technical details that emphasize the innovative aspects of your project. This could be from the code you uploaded.

6. **Conclusion and Future Directions**:
   "This system revolutionizes the way we interact with extensive medical documents, providing immediate, accurate answers to specific queries. Future iterations could integrate more advanced models, expand to different document types, and offer multi-language support."

7. **Acknowledgments**:
   If you've worked with a team or had any mentors/advisors, this is a good section to acknowledge their contributions.

**Additional Elements**:
- **Screenshots**: Display your project in action. This helps the viewer visualize the interface and interaction.
- **Code Snippet**: A brief code section or two can highlight the technical depth of your project. I can help select these from the uploaded files.
- **Team Photos**: If you're presenting with a team or planning to attend the Career Showcase, including team photos can make the poster more personal and approachable.

Why not just train or fine-tune a LLM?

GPT learns knowledge through model weights (fine-tuning) or model inputs (knowledge inserted into an input message). Fine-tuning is less reliable for factual recall.

Fine-tuning is similar to studying for an exam in advance, where the model may forget details or misremember facts it never encountered. On the other hand, message inputs act as short-term memory, similar to taking an exam with open notes.

One limitation of text search compared to fine-tuning is the maximum amount of text the model can read at once. Therefore, to create a system capable of answering questions using extensive text sources (clinical practice guidelines in our case), we will try the Search-Ask method.



Object-Oriented Design in Python: Adopted a modular and scalable object-oriented approach in Python, ensuring maintainability and extensibility. This design facilitates easy integration of future enhancements without disrupting the existing functionality.

Dynamic Configuration Management: Utilized an innovative YAML-based configuration system. This allows for easy adjustments to model parameters, vector storage choices, and document paths, fostering rapid experimentation and iterative development. Python classes and methods are seamlessly integrated with this configuration system, streamlining the setup and modification processes.

Streamlit Application: Leveraged the Streamlit framework to create an intuitive and interactive web interface. This user-friendly front-end masks the complex backend processes, providing users with a straightforward experience.

Advanced Vector Storage: Implemented FAISS and Chroma, cutting-edge vector databases, ensuring efficient storage and rapid similarity searches. This architecture is pivotal for real-time querying of extensive medical datasets.

Sophisticated Document Handling: Integrated various document loaders with special emphasis on handling online PDFs. The system employs intricate text splitting algorithms, optimizing the embedding process and ensuring high-quality vector representations.

Custom Language Model Prompts: Crafted specialized prompts that guide the OpenAI language model, ensuring precise and context-aware responses. This design choice was pivotal in achieving high accuracy in responses, particularly when querying dense medical documents.

This version provides a deeper dive into the technical architecture and emphasizes the design choices that make the project unique. Let me know if this aligns with your vision or if you'd like further refinements!
