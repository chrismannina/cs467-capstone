**About Docere**

In the tapestry of language and purpose, "Docere" stands as a beacon of clarity. Rooted in the Latin "docere," our name is not just an etymological ancestor to both "document" and "doctor" but a testament to our ethos. This word, signifying "to teach" or "to show," gave rise to "documentum," representing instruction, and later, our modern "document." Similarly, it laid the foundation for "doctor," the guardians of medical wisdom.

Before we embraced the name "Docere," our inception was grounded in a singular vision: to create a sanctuary for medical guideline queries. We sought to build a bridge between the nuanced world of clinical documents and the individuals striving to decipher them. Today, "Docere" transcends this vision, merging the dedication of a doctor with the clarity of a document.
